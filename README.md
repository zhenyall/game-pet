## My Tamagochi

## Object Oriented Programming Practice Ruby.

## Why Ruby?
Ruby is an extremely accessible programming language, especially for beginners. It emphasizes readability, versatility, and ease of use.

In other words, learning Ruby code allows you to focus on what you are doing and why, rather than worrying about whether} follows a;.

Ultimately, it doesn't really matter which programming language you start with, the basic concepts of good software development are consistent across almost any language, the most important thing is to dive in, start playing, create, and have fun along the way.

## Tasks

It is necessary to write a tamagotchi program. You must create a Pet class. Each pet must have a name specified during creation. There must be the name of the animal (Dog, Cat, Parrot or ...), life, mood, hunger, sleep, mood + two indicators at your discretion. There should be a private method (under private) that would emulate the passage of 1 day (or an hour, or several hours), when some indicators change, for example, the pet becomes more hungry, less sleepy (by a random amount within the specified limits), etc. etc. There should be 10-20 methods that would allow you to perform certain actions with the animal, for example, "feed", "put to sleep", "play". Each of these actions must change one or several parameters of the animal, as well as call a private method of passing time. For example, we can feed our pet, but a certain amount of time will pass. There should be a method that allows you to simply observe the pets - at this time some random event may occur. With the wrong care, the pet can die, get angry and eat you (if it is carnivorous) or run away. It is necessary to create a simple menu so that you can play with your pet from the console. There should also be a help method that would allow you to display all the commands for the pet and descriptions for them.

a simple example of a Dragon pet to create a menu, you can use until command == 'exit'â€¦ end and case with pet commands inside;

## Implementation:

- First, copy or download this repository

- <https://github.com/zhenyall/RubyHW.git>

- $ git clone https://github.com/zhenyall/RubyHW.git 

## Next enter this command:

$ ruby main.rb

- A menu for creating a pet will open if it does not exist, or a menu for interaction if a pet has already been created.

## Have a good game :)
